_\[A picture of the Comet King, aged beyond his years, his face looking haggard but determined, lost in shadows. The text says “Somebody had to, no one would / I tried to do the best I could / And now it’s done, and now they can’t ignore us / And even though it all went wrong / I’ll stand against the whole unsong / With nothing on my tongue but HaMephorash”.

Thanks to the Bayesian Choir, you can now hear all of HaMephorash sung the way it was intended. Listen to them [here](http://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/HaMephorash.mp3).
